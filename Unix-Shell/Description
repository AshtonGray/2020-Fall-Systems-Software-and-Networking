This project creates a simple unix shell in C that supports job control, and shows the concepts of
process control and signaling

A shell is an interactive command-line intepreter that runs programs on behalf of the user

Functions Created:
- eval: Main routine that parses and interprets the command line
- do_bgfg: Implements the bg and fg built-in commands
- waitfg: waits for a foreground job to complete
- sigchld_handler: Catches SIGCHILD signals
- sigint_handler: Catches SIGINT (ctrl-c) signals
- sigstp_handler: Catches SIGTSTP (ctrl-z) signals
